This is a supporting site for the source code of the paper 'Instant Time-Series Classification via Deep Multi-Task Learning' by Josif Grabocka and Lars Schmidt-Thieme.


In order to run the code:

1 - Clone the repository locally


2 - We provided the smallest dataset HAR for testing the code, the other datasets exceed the Github file upload limit. Unzip the *.zip files in the folders 'HAR/0/', 'HAR/1/' and 'HAR/2/'.
